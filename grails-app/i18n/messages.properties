index.welcome= Welcome to <b><i>PlantChemDB</i></b>
index.welcome.text=<strong>The Plant Chemotype DATABASE (PlantChem DB)</strong> is <b>free continually updated unique Web-resource</b> for plant essential oils, containing scientifically approved experimental records of plants' essential oil composition, spread across diverse geographical locations all over the globe. This resource does not have analogous on the Internet. What is more it is available in two languages: English and Russia.
index.welcome.text2=<strong>PlantChem DB</strong> is equipped with three powerful tools of fast and effective search:
index.filter1.title= Chemotype abundance
index.filter1.description= This type of search provides you with an opportunity to find actual information about the chemotypes of chosen species all over world. In the chemoType's description you will be able to find reference where the chosen  chemoType was describes and also to obtain details  about the sample preparation and analysis procedures. What is more this type of search is equipped with Comparative analysis between chemotypes.
index.filter2.title= Compound abundance and its properties
index.filter2.description= This type of search could help you to get the information about the specific chemical compound of the plants' essential oil composition (structural formula, physical and pharmacological properties). Also you will obtain the information about species containing chosen compound and its contentin the essential oil composition of listed species and chemotypes.
index.filter3.title= Chemotype search
index.filter3.description= If you have obtained your own results of plants' essential oil composition (for example, on the basis of GC/MS data) this type of search will help you to find similar chemotypes of your chosen plant with the same compound' percentages as you have found.

#faq
faq.title=FAQ
faq.question1.title=Is PlantChemDB absolutely free resource?
faq.question1.description=Yes, PlantChemDB is an absolutely free app. You do not need to pay any fee for its use.
faq.question2.title=Do I need to install any additional software to use PlantChemDB?
faq.question2.description=No, you don't. This resource does not need special software and will be suitable for using in all browsers with java script support. All what you need is the Internes access.
faq.question3.title=Can I use PlantChemDB on my tablet or do I need a laptop?
faq.question3.description=Yes, you can use PlantChemDB on your tablet. App PlantChemDB is equipped with adaptive design, that is why you can use it both on computers and tablets or mobile phones. All what you need is the Internes access.
faq.question4.title=What is chemoType?
faq.question4.description=Chemotype is a chemical variety of the same plant's species with constant high content of one or several chemical compounds in obtained essential oil. That is why in terms of one species the existence of several chemotypes is possible which do not differ from each other in components set, but its contents can vary in a wide range. Traditionally the chemoType is determined according to its dominant component, and the existence of any chemoType is assumed to be the reason of different geographic location of growth, that is why for different countries the definite set of chemotypes is possible.
faq.question5.title=I do not know family, genus and species of the plant under the study?
faq.question5.description=If you do not know taxonomic classification of the plant under your study use web-identificators of plants. For example, <a href="https://gobotany.newenglandwild.org/simple/">https://gobotany.newenglandwild.org/simple/</a>.
faq.question6.title=I have a lot of publications about essential oil composition, but I do not find them in PlantChemDB?
faq.question6.description=If you are an author of a number of publications in essential oil study, but you have observed that PlantChemDB does not contain them, send your articles or its links in journals to our mail plantchemdb@gmail.com. As a result your experimental data will be able to a wide range of scientist of your filed which will lead undoubtedly to the increase of your citation index.
